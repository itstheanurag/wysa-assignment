# approach 1

get all the data from req.body (from frontend) to mongoDb and then process that data 

route.post('/userDetails',-------


successfull response 

{
    "nickName": "Disco",
    "questions": {
        "struggleTime": "9 weeks",
        "bedTime": 2,
        "wakeUpTime": 19,
        "sleepHours": 5
    },
    "_id": "62ee143dfd5992043e61b25a",
    "__v": 0
}



# approach 2 

post-->put-->put -->put 

post data nickName 
then put all the question on null 

then update one by one by endPoints


route.post('/nickName,---)

router.put('/struggleTime',----)

router.put('bedTime',-----)

router.put('/sleepHours',--------)

they all are linked with the same uniqueID ("62ee03602acc2e9092a50245")
send again and again from diff endpoints Via Header token or simple body Token
